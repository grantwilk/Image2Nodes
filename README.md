## Img2Nodes

Img2Nodes is a goofy Blender 2.79 add-on I made that converts any image in the UV/Image Editor into colored compositor nodes. It doesn't do anything practical, but it was fun to make!

Note that Blender can only handle so many compositor nodes. You shouldn't try to use an image with a resolution of more than 50x50 pixels, otherwise Blender is likely to crash!
